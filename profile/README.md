> **Heads-up:** Weâ€™re still setting upâ€”only this README is public for now. Watch or star the org to get notified when the code and registry go live.

**MCPmed** will make biomedical data servicesâ€”APIs, databases, archives, and -omics portalsâ€”LLM-ready using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

## MCPmed Template

### Template for python mcp package
Find the template [here](https://github.com/MCPmed/Cookiecutter-MCPmed).
Ideally, you can use the template to create a new MCPmed package to wrap an existing API.
```bash
cookiecutter MCPmedtemplate
```

### Other templates coming soon



## Mission

* **Accelerate translational science** â€“ expose curated clinical and molecular datasets through self-describing MCP manifests so agents can query datasets, cohorts, or biomarkers programmatically.  
* **Lower adoption barriers** â€“ ship MIT-licensed templates
